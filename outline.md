# Project Outline: Predicting Stock Prices Using Linear and Polynomial Regression Models

## 1. Introduction

### Project Objective
- Develop models using both linear and polynomial regression to predict stock prices based on financial ratios.
- Create a substantial alpha.

### Significance
- Accurate stock price prediction is critical for financial analysis, enabling informed decision-making for investors and businesses.

### Methodology Overview
- **Linear Regression Model**
- **Polynomial Regression Model**
- **Exponential/Logarithmic Model?**
- **Comparison of Model Performances**

## 2. Dataset and Preprocessing

### 2.1. Data Description
Variables included in the financial dictionary (`fin_info`):
- **Current Ratios**: `l_current_ratio`
- **Quick Ratios**: `l_quick_ratio`
- **Debt-to-Equity Ratios**: `l_de_ratio`
- **Inventory Turnover Ratios**: `l_inv_turnover_ratio`
- **Fixed Asset Turnovers**: `l_avg_fixed`
- **Gross Profit Margins**: `l_gross_profit_margin`
- **Quality of Incomes**: `l_income_quality_ratio`
- **Capital Acquisition Ratios**: `l_cap_acq_ratio`
- **Dates**: `l_date`

### 2.2. Data Collection
- Collect data on financial information and historical stock prices using the AlphaVantage API.

### 2.3. Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values, outliers, and perform data normalization as necessary.

### 2.4. Feature Engineering
- Convert date features if needed (e.g., extract month/year for seasonality analysis).
- Create lag variables or moving averages if applicable.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 3.1. Statistical Summary
- Summary statistics (mean, median, variance, covariance, etc.) of financial ratios.

### 3.2. Correlation Analysis
- Covariance/Correlation matrix to identify relationships between variables and stock prices.

### 3.3. Data Visualization
- Scatter plots of each financial ratio against stock prices.
- Line plots showing trends over time for stock prices and financial ratios.

## 4. Model Development

### 4.1. Model 1: Linear Regression
- Formulate the linear regression model using the financial ratios as independent variables and stock prices as the dependent variable.

#### Equation
- <code>y = β₀ + β₁ ⋅ X₁ + β₂ ⋅ X₂ + ⋯ + βₙ ⋅ Xₙ</code>


#### Steps
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Train the linear model on the training data.
- Evaluate performance using metrics like RMSE, \( R^2 \).

### 4.2. Model 2: Polynomial Regression
- Extend the model to polynomial regression to capture non-linear relationships.

#### Equation
-  <code>y = β₀ + β₁ ⋅ X₁^{i1} + β₂ ⋅ X₂^{i2} + ⋯ + βₙ ⋅ Xₙ^{i3}, i ≥ 0</code>

#### Steps
- Use polynomial features (e.g., 2nd or 3rd degree polynomials).
- Train and test using the same dataset.
- Evaluate using the same metrics.

## 5. Model Evaluation and Comparison

### 5.1. Performance Metrics
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **\( R^2 \) Score**

### 5.2. Model Comparison
- Compare the performance of linear vs polynomial models using the evaluation metrics.
- Analyze whether the polynomial model significantly improves prediction accuracy over the linear model.

## 6. Conclusion

### 6.1. Summary of Results
- Discuss the findings and the performance of both models.

### 6.2. Recommendations
- Provide recommendations on whether linear or polynomial models are more suitable for stock price prediction using the given financial data.

### 6.3. Limitations
- Discuss any limitations (e.g., overfitting with polynomial regression, data quality).

### 6.4. Future Work
- Suggest potential improvements or future extensions (e.g., incorporating other machine learning algorithms, using more financial indicators).
